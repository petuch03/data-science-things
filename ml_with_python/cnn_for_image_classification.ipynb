    "In this homework, you need to write a convolutional neural network for image classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "You have been provided with a modified dataset of The Street View House Numbers (SVHN). It contains 50 thousand (train) + 25 thousand (test) 32x32 RGB images with numbers cut from real photos of house numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task: use convolutional neural networks to achieve maximum classification accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this homework task, there are no restrictions on the architecture of the model, but you need to implement it in PyTorch by yourself and train it from scratch only on this dataset, without external data.\n",
